Alright what will this project be?

i think of a microservice that can analyse medical reports.
this analysis will extract relevant data.
this data will be used to come up with possible next steps.
there can be a visualizer for patients data.


this microservice will be small enough that we can work on it and impresive enough to show
we have learned something.
it can also be used in subsequent project to expand on health care.

yasin will mostly do the backend and our API.
hamid will mostly do the ml service.
hamid will work on a web-scraper.
front will be done by both.
we should document what we do and remember to write comments in our code.

backend will be written using C# and ASP.net.
ml service will use FastAPI to expose the AI backend as an API.
